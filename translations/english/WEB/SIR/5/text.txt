Set not your heart upon your goods;
And say not, They are sufficient for me.

Follow not your own mind and your strength,
To walk in the desires of your heart;

And say not, Who shall have dominion over me?
For the Lord will surely take vengeance on you.

Say not, I sinned, and what happened to me?
For the Lord is longsuffering.

Concerning atonement, be not without fear,
To add sin upon sins:

And say not, His compassion is great;
He will be pacified for the multitude of my sins:
For mercy and wrath are with him,
And his indignation will rest upon sinners.

Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord;
And put not off from day to day:
For suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth;
And you shall perish in the time of vengeance.

Set not your heart upon unrighteous gains:
For you shall profit nothing in the day of calamity.

Winnow not with every wind,
And walk not in every path:
Thus does the sinner that has a double tongue.

Be stedfast in your understanding;
And let your word be one.

Be swift to hear;
And with patience make your answer.

If you have understanding, answer your neighbor;
And if not, let your hand be upon your mouth.

Glory and dishonor is in talk:
And the tongue of a man is his fall.

Be not called a whisperer;
And lie not in wait with your tongue:
For upon the thief there is shame,
And an evil condemnation upon him that has a double tongue.

In a great matter and in a small, be not ignorant;
