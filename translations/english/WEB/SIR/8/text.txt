Contend not with a mighty man,
Lest haply you fall into his hands.

Strive not with a rich man, lest haply he overweigh you:
For gold has destroyed many,
And turned aside the hearts of kings.

Contend not with a man that is full of tongue,
And heap not wood upon his fire.

Jest not with a rude man,
Lest your ancestors be dishonored.

Reproach not a man when he turns from sin:
Remember that we are all worthy of punishment.

Dishonour not a man in his old age;
For some of us also are waxing old.

Rejoice not over one that is dead:
Remember that we die all.

Neglect not the discourse of the wise,
And be conversant with their proverbs;
For of them you shall learn instruction,
And how to minister to great men.

Miss not the discourse of the aged;
For they also learned of their fathers:
Because from them you shall learn understanding,
And to give answer in time of need.

Kindle not the coals of a sinner,
Lest you be burned with the  flame of his fire.

Rise not up from the presence of an insolent man,
Lest he lie in wait as an ambush for your mouth.

Lend not to a man that is mightier than yourself;
And if you lend, be as one that has lost.

Be not surety above your power:
And if you be surety, take thought as one that will have to pay.

Go not to law with a judge;
For according to his honor will they give judgement for him.

Go not in the way with a rash man,
Lest he be aggrieved with you;
For he will do according to his own will,
And you shall perish with his folly.

Fight not with a wrathful man,
And travel not with him through the desert:
For blood is as nothing in his sight;
And where there is no help, he will overthrow you.

Take not counsel with a fool;
For he will not be able to conceal the matter.

Do no secret thing before a stranger;
For you know not what  he will bring forth.

Open not your heart to every man;
And let him not return you a favor.
