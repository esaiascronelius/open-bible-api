And Tobit his father made his count every day: and when the days of the journey were expired, and they came not,
he said,  Is he perchance detained? or is Gabael perchance dead, and there is no man to give him the money?
And he was sorely grieved.
But his wife said to him, The child has perished, seeing he waits long; and she began to bewail him, and said,
I care for nothing, my child, since I have let you go, the light of mine eyes.
And Tobit says to her, Hold your peace, take no care; he is in good health.
And she said to him, Hold your peace, deceive me not; my child has perished. And she went out every day into the way by which they went, and did eat no bread in the day-time, and ceased not whole nights to bewail her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding feast were expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there.
But Tobias said to Raguel, Send me away, for my father and my mother look no more to see me.
But his father in law said to him, Abide with me, and I will send to your father, and they shall declare to him how things go with you.
And Tobias says, No; but send me away to my father.
But Raguel arose, and gave him Sarah his wife, and half his goods, servants and cattle and money;
and he blessed them, and sent them away, saying, The God of heaven shall prosper you, my children, before I die.
And he said to his daughter, Honor your father and your mother in law; they are now your parents; let me hear a good report of you. And he kissed her. And Edna said to Tobias, The Lord of heaven restore you, dear brother, and grant to me that I may see your children of my daughter Sarah, that I may rejoice before the Lord: and, behold, I commit my daughter to you in special trust: vex her not.
