And Tobias called Raphael, and said to him,
Brother Azarias, take with you a servant, and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and receive the money for me, and bring him to the wedding feast:
because Raguel has sworn that I shall not depart;
and my father counts the days; and if I wait long, he will be sorely grieved.
And Raphael went on his way, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting: but he brought forth the bags with their seals, and gave them to him.
And they rose up early in the morning together, and came to the wedding feast: and Tobias blessed his wife.
